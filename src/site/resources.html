			<h2>Release Notes</h2>
            <h3>Aika Version 0.23 (2018-11-14)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Range class has now been replaced with by a slots concept. Previously had a range with a begin and an end position.
                    Now activations can possess an arbitrary number of positions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The synapse bias is now used to decide whether a synapse is conjunctive or disjunctive.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Aika Version 0.22 (2018-10-31)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    API Refactoring: Synapse relations are now established through a separate builder class.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The range positions are now optionally variable. This feature is required for text generation. In this
                    use case the positions are not known in advance and need to be computed during processing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Introduced passive neurons. Passive neurons are only evaluated if the connected output neuron requires it.
                    Passive neurons act basically like callback functions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Optimization of the interpretation search.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lots of bug fixes.
                </li>
            </ul>

			<h3>Aika Version 0.17 (2018-05-14)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Introduction of synapse relations. Previously the relation between synapses was implicitly modeled
					through word positions (RIDs). Now it is possible to explicitly model relations like: The end position of
					input activation 1 equals to the begin position of input activation 2. Two types of relations are
					currently supported, range relations and instance relations. Range relations compare the input
					activation range of a given synapse with that of the linked synapse. Instance relations also compare
					the input activations of two synapses, but instead of the ranges the dependency relations of these
					activations are compared.
				</li>
				<li>
					Removed the norm term from the interpretation objective function.
				</li>
				<li>
					Introduced an optional distance function to synapses. It allows to model a weakening signal depending
					on the distance of the activation ranges.
				</li>
				<li>
					Example implementation of a context free grammar.
				</li>
				<li>
					Example implementation for co-reference resolution.
				</li>
				<li>
					Work on an syllable identification experiment based on the meta network implementation.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Aika Version 0.15 (2018-03-16)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Simplified interpretation handling by removing the InterpretationNode class and moving the remaining logic to the Activation class.
				</li>
				<li>
					Moved the activation linking and activation selection code to separate classes.
				</li>
				<li>
					Ongoing work on the training algorithms.
				</li>
			</ul>


			<h3>Aika Version 0.14 (2018-02-04)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Caching of partially computed states in the neural network during the interpretation search.
				</li>
				<li>
					Refactoring of the interpretation search. The search is now iterative to prevent stack overflows. The debugging output is much more detailed now.
				</li>
				<li>
					Ongoing work on the training algorithms.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Aika Version 0.13 (2018-01-20)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					API cleanups: Input -> Synapse.Builder, Activation.Builder
				</li>
				<li>
					Optimization and simplification of the interpretation search.
				</li>
				<li>
					Refactoring of the range matching within synapses.
				</li>
				<li>
					Ongoing work on the training algorithms.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Aika Version 0.12 (2017-12-12)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Memory optimization: Disjunctive synapses are now stored on the input neuron side.
				</li>
				<li>
					The bias delta value in a neuron input is now an absolute value.
				</li>
				<li>
					Bug fixes, code cleanups, code readability improvements, lambda expression usage, convenience functions.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Aika Version 0.11 (2017-11-26)</h3>

			</ul>

			<h3>Aika Version 0.10 (2017-11-03)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Simplification: Activations are now only added during processing never removed. However, they might be
					suppressed if they are conflicting with other activations.
				</li>
				<li>
					Removed some old experimental training code and provided two APIs for training and pattern discovery.
					The APIs allow to implement heuristics when deciding which synapses should be created or which
					patterns should be selected.
				</li>
				<li>
					Experimental support for text generation.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Aika Version 0.9 (2017-10-22)</h3>
